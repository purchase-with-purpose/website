# Blocks 

Blocks are schematic representations of a single piece of data (for example a specific value associated with `software`, etc.) that can be shown to a user in the UI in various ways. 

At the moment it can be shown as one of two variants (`compact` and `sidebar`) in the `DataBlock` component.

Note that all `block` designations are also each associated with one of several larger `group` structures.
